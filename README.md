# Homework4: Code Quiz
This application is designed to test the test taker's knowledge of seemingly pointless and random information. There are 20 questions that the test taker has 120 seconds to complete, but for each incorrect answer 15 seconds are deducted. The final score is determined by the time remaining after 20 questions, or is simply 0 if the test taker was unable to finish. The user inputs his initial and submits them alongside his final score, which is posted to a high scores page. The list of initals and scores is saved to local storage. The user can choose to clear the list from the high score page. The user then has the option to take the quiz again, or to return to the initial home page. The test taker may choose to visit the high score page at any time, but doing so in the middle of the test will end it prematurely.
